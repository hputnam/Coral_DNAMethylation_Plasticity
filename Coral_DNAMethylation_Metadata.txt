Filename=BM_Buoyant_Weight_Repeated.csv

Samples were weighed and reweighed if any pieces were broken off or epoxy fell off resulting in an inital weight and final weight for each weighing day.  For the final data, the change in wet is presented as initial weight of the subsequent timepoint minus the final weight of the prior time point, normalized to the final weight of the prior time point and divided by the number of days between for final units of % weight change per day in analysis. Data in file are wet mass measurements.
